Earth Hour is a WordPress plugin that will temporarily disable a blog during Earth Hour to show support for the initiative and the environment. It also displays a thin banner on your website prior to event which shows your support, links to earthhour.org and announces how many other WordPress websites are using the plugin.

== Description ==

During Earth Hour (which starts at 8:30pm local time on Saturday, March 28th, 2015), your blog will show a message of support for the initiative, along with every other WordPress site utilizing this plugin.
